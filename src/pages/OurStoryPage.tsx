                <p>
                  Mosadie Gives Back (MGB) was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to ensure that
                  no child in our community goes to bed hungry. What started in 2017 as a small
                  initiative to feed a few hundred children has blossomed into a movement that serves
                  over 40,000 meals per month.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our founder, Faranaaz Dramat, witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of hunger
                  on children in the Tafelsig area. She knew that education, growth, and development
                  were impossible on an empty stomach. This realization sparked the creation of MGB.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we work tirelessly to provide healthy, nutritious meals to families who
                  struggle to put food on the table. Our mission extends beyond just feeding children
                  â€“ we are building a community where every child has the opportunity to thrive.

                <p>
                  Every day, our dedicated team and volunteers work together to prepare and distribute
                  nutritious meals to families in need. We focus on providing balanced, healthy food
                  that supports childrens growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our feeding program operates throughout the week, ensuring consistency and
                  reliability for the families who depend on us. We believe that proper nutrition is a
                  fundamental right, not a privilege.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond meals, we create a sense of community and belonging. Our feeding stations
                  serve as gathering places where families connect, children play, and hope is
                  restored.

                  We are committed to transparency, dignity, and respect in everything we do. Every

                  valued and supported.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our motto, If we do not feed these children, they do not eat drives us every single
                  day. It is not just about providing food its about creating opportunities for
                  children to learn, grow, and dream.
